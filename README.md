# IMDb-Movie-Search-Engine
A small search engine built for searching movies by name or part name. Gives movies in ascending or descending order based on year of release. Searches for movies specific actors have appeared in and finds movies released in a given year. Each movies has 28 fields including its name, release year, actors directors, etc.

The Binary Search Tree is used to save all the movies based on release year. Seperate Hash Maps are used to save actors and directors based on thier names. Within the Hash Maps, Linked Lists are utilized. Recursive and iterative methods are used to traverse through these to search for required movie. Templated for these are given.

The movies are saved in a comma seperated file.

The entire code is written in Python (version 3.9) using the Visual Studio Code IDE (version 1.67.0).
